= Extending

The imgNotes widget is built using the https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/[jQuery UI Widget Factory].
Extending the functionality of the widget is a relatively simple process as described in
https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/[Extending Widgets with the Widget Factory]. It
is itself just an extension of my https://github.com/waynegm/imgViewer[imgViewer] widget.

As an example
[source, javascript]
----
$.widget("wgm.imgExtension", $.wgm.imgNotes, {
	options: {
	}
});
