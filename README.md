imgNotes
=========

imgNotes is a jQuery plugin that extends the [imgViewer](https://github.com/waynegm/imgViewer) plugin to allow annotations (eg markers and notes) to be added to an image that can be zoomed and panned.

It is an easily extended, responsive UI component based on the jQuery widget factory and uses [Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/) for touch event support. It should work on all browsers and platforms supported by [Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/).

If you don't find this plugin has what you need check out my [imgViewer2](https://github.com/waynegm/imgViewer2) plugin that uses the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/index.html) mapping library for the underlying image display.
